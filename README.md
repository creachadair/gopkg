# gopkg

[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=godoc&message=reference&color=yellow)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/creachadair/gopkg)

This repository provides minimal Go package that makes queries against the
[godoc.org](https://godoc.org) JSON API.

Since that site has mostly been subsumed by pkg.go.dev, which does not have a
replacement API, it is probably not wise to rely on this continuing to work
indefinitely.
